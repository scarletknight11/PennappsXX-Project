# PennappsXX-Project
Project designed for Assistance to visually impaired individual
In our day to day lives we often see blind/visually impaired people navigate the world. However sometimes we can see them accidentally coding with people or not notice busy street ways that don't have their lights. So we made EyeSee!

Project was built at Pennapps Fall 2019
